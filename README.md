# ANTLR-Lexical-Analysis
For this task, you need to implement a lexical analyzer using ANTLR 

Requirements:We would like to construct a tokenizer with the following specifications. Given an input string over a subset of a pseudo programming language, the tokenizer should split the input into lexemes and produce an output token for each lexeme.
